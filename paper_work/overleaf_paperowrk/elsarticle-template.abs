In this study, we have investigated the decadal change in interannual Sea Level anomaly (SLA) of the Bay of Bengal (BoB) using observed satellite altimeter data and a linear, continuously, and stratified (LCS) model. A rapid increase in SLA during the 2010-19 decade is observed compared to the 2000-09 decade throughout the Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter seasons. In order to explain the observed variability, We have executed some numerical experiments using LCS model. The significant change in Ekman pumping and equatorial forcing drives the change in decadal SLA along the western bay of Bengal. The contribution of forcing due to the boundary of the western BoB and Eastern BoB including the Andaman and Nicobar islands is not notable.
